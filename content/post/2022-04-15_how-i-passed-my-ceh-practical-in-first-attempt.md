First of all, I am not a complete beginner in infosec/cyber security community. I have been doing bugbounty for past 3 years and also my current job role is related to security engineer.

So, I haven’t prepared much as I already use most of the tools frequently at my workplace/CTFs/BugBounty.

I decided to go with CEH (Practical) as I have got scholarship for the same and amount was $100, which also I earned by winning a private CTF. So decided to invest the money earned through CTF in a good certification.

I first read about other people experiences in reddit, medium and personal blogs (Google them, Please !!!) and I understood the exam pattern and type of question one could expect, I knew that, this is definitely going to be easy for me, so decided to directly attempt the exam without much preparation.

FYI, have been already preparing for OSCP and have completed few labs in [THM (Offensive Pentesting Learning Path)](https://tryhackme-certificates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/THM-YJ4UYSVIZK.png) for that sake. This might also have helped me in learning about common vulnerabilities, exploits, tools usages & completing the exam in short period of time (less than 3 hrs).

I started preparing notes regarding usage of tools, so that it might come handy in exam. Note that it’s open book exam, you are allowed to use the internet.

My Notes: [https://ceh-prep.jayateerthag.in/](https://ceh-prep.jayateerthag.in/)

The notes do not contain everything, but you can learn about basic usage of tools which can be used at different situations.

Other than the tools mentioned in my blog, you may need to learn about tools like Veracrypt, BCTextEncoder, CrypTool, ADB.

Also try to learn more about filters and statistics usages in wireshark.

And Finally, you can view my certificate [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o9HxKzJ2903RqX7z_7UnHZrl6hlWhHuP/view).
