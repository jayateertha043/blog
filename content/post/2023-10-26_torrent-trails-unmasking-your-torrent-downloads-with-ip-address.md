**Torrent Trails: Unmasking Your Torrent Downloads with IP Address**

Public IP address is mostly assigned static to each unique person by an ISP in most of the cases.

Few ISP might allocate single IP to multiple persons or allocate IP’s dynamically. (In these cases this technique might not work correctly)

Okay, what can a attacker accomplish by knowing public ip address of the victim ? --> **Read my detailed blog** [**here**](https://stopify.co/showthread.php?id=OIJ4RG) .

> In many countries, watching of pirated content might not be illegal, but **distribution of pirated content, movies, cracked softwares or any data which you are not authorised to distribute may land you in prison**.

So, you say I am not the owner of TamilRockers or ThePirateBay to distribute pirated content, How will I get arrested ?

**When you are downloading a file from torrent, you are simultaneously advertising your IP address as well as distributing the content of torrent file to other peers too !**

So you become a distributor of the file from the moment you start downloading the file from torrent.

And there are sites like [iknowwhatyoudownload.com](https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/en/contacts/) which keeps track of all the major torrent files and keep listening to DHT Network for peer IP address facts daily.

**Input your IP address in the above website and you can check the files you have downloaded/uploaded through torrent network recently.**

That’s the reason people say, do not click on any links blindly as websites might be tracking IP address of visitors.

On a funny as well as educational note — [Here’s](https://grabify.link/track/WXCKSP) the list of IP address of people who blindly clicked a link in this blog. (It’s ok to learn from your mistakes !)

**What we have learnt through this blog ?** -

1. Do not download or distribute pirated content as it might end you up in Prison.
2. Never click any link blindly.
3. Use VPN or Tor to remain anonymous to some extent when using internet. (Again these might be illegal in few countries, take your own decisions respecting the laws of your country, I am not responsible for any of your actions)
